# DragArea

This is an android library project that provides drag and drop operations
on top of android-10.

Starting in android-11 (Android 3.0 / Honeycomb) Google provided drag and
drop API's of their own. This library is based loosely on those API's
and so may be useful to people wishing to develop for Android 2.0 who
want an easyish upgrade path.

Documentation is available at 
[http://doffm.github.com/android-dragarea/](http://doffm.github.com/android-dragarea/).

A small example using this library can be found at 
[https://github.com/doffm/android-dragexample](https://github.com/doffm/android-dragexample).
